#+TITLE: Notes
* Learned that we can use app with props by declaring props in rendering
* also we can use the map method to print out all the content
** example at: src/index.js line:3
- but doing this though will make a nasty error
  - stating that "each child in an array or iterator should have a unique 'key' prop"
- Solution:
  #+begin_export javascript
  <li key={note.id}>
  {note.content}
  </li>
  #+end_export
* in importing you can omit the .js
** import Note from './components/Note'
